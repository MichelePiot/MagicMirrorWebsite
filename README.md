# MagicMirrorWebsite
A website interface design for a collaboration project for a smart mirror.

The first step for this design process was to discuss specific goals and objectives for website. 

The ideation process started with the determining the needs of the website. This process was broken up into major, minor, and nice to have categories. 

Major (Primary needs):
1. wifi setup
2. connecting to wifi/product
3. forgetting wifi/disconnecting

Minor (Secondary needs):
1. change passoword/login information
2. enable/disable notifications
3. updates

Nice to have:
1. reboot/reset/troubleshooting

After determining the primary needs of the user, wireframes were created to show early visualizations of the interface.

After creating a sample of homepages and initial mockups, they were transformed into low fidelity prototypes to visualize alternate design solutions and more concrete visualization of the interface.

Some of the initial mockups show a progression sequence and will later be implimented into mid fidelity prototypes to show the actions of the user.
